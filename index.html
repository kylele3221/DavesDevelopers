The program specifically uses the multiple layers intensity and depth of coverage maps to represent multiple dimensions in the sonification process.  Our project aims to create an immersive audio experience in order to better appreciate the night sky given by the sky atlas, and we are able to achieve this by showcasing our data as eerie and dissonant. </p>

			<p style="color: white; width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">	Our team developed a sonification interpretation of the WISE Full-Depth Ecliptic Polar Atlas Image Sets that make up the all sky atlas. 41 atlas data sets make up the all sky atlas, and for our project we focused on sonifying one of these data sets. Each data set contains intensity maps, depth of coverage maps, and uncertainty maps in .fits files. We decided to focus on the intensity and depth of coverage maps, and each of these has several layers. For the intensity maps, we mapped the amplitudes and frequencies of a sound wave function to the corresponding pixel in the fits data. We did these for each of the four intensity files, and output the sound in a .wave file from back to back from first to fourth, respectively. For the depth of coverage maps, we decided to go with a more creative approach. We took the top three depth of coverage maps, and assigned each map to a different rgb channel. We then layered these rgb channels together in all possible combinations to create six new colored depth of coverage maps. From there, we took the rgb value of one of the more color rich pixels and rounded it to the nearest “pure color,” those being the seven colors of the rainbow along with black. We then attributed each “pure color” to the frequency of a note on the normal octave of a piano, and created sound waves by reading these colors. This sound file was output as a .wav file, and played the six notes in order of the combinations of depth of coverage maps. Within the Digital Audio Workstation Ableton, we lengthed the audio files by dropping them two octaves. Then we layered the intensity and depth of coverage .wav files on top of each other to construct an immersive audio experience. To ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data representation the entirety of the experience was constructed with the outputted sound files. In order to accomplish this, we wrote a Python program to generate the raw sounds.  We coded in PyCharm Professional, and utilized the libraries astropy, matplotlib, numpy, and pillow. After our raw wav files were generated, we edited the audio files together in Ableton Live. As for hardware, this was simply done on our personal laptops which run a variety of consumer grade hardware.</p>
